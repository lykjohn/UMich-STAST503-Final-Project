# UMich-STAST503-Final-Project

With the rise to prominence in the United States of socialist figures such as Senator Bernie Sanders, much of the recent
political discourse has been centered around wealth inequality. Additionally, with the recent economic downturn caused by
COVID-19, this issue has been thrust even more into the center stage. Much has been discussed in the literature regarding
the positive associations between poverty and difficulty finding work, worsened medical outcomes, and poorer overall health
and well-being. Thus, we decided to investigate the associations between median county income and a variety of economic
indicators by county in the United States. It is our hope that the insights gathered from our analysis can be used to better
understand what occurs in poorer neighborhoods and hopefully identify suggestions as to what can be done in order to
improve those situations.
